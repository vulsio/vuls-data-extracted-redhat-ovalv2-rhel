				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in squid. Due to improper validation while parsing the request URI, squid is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling. This issue could allow a trusted client to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack and access services otherwise forbidden by squid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is not tied to a specific proxy type (e.g., forward or reverse) and has been rated as having a security impact of Important. This flaw affects the versions of Squid as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by setting the `uri_whitespace` directive in squid.conf to either: \n\n```\nuri_whitespace deny\n```\nor\n```\nuri_whitespace encode\n```",
