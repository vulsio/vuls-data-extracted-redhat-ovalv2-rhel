				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in spamassassin. Malicious rule configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands without any output or errors allowing exploits to be injected in a number of scenarios. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            \n            MITIGATION: This vulnerability can only be exploited through a malicious rule configuration file. If you are using third-party rule configuration files, it is important to ensure they come only from trusted sources, or are inspected prior to deployment. Even in the absence of this vulnerability, malicious rule configurations could cause significant disruptions to email processed by SpamAssassin.",
