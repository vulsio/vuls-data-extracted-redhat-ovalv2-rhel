				"title": "CVE-2020-14060 jackson-databind: serialization in oadd.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool (low)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jackson-databind 2.x in versions prior to 2.9.10.5. The interaction between serialization gadgets and typing is mishandled. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nThe PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nThe version of jackson-databind as shipped in Red Hat Software Collections rh-maven35 is used only while building maven, thus it does not deserialize data coming from untrusted sources, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product.\n            MITIGATION: The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible:\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* enableDefaultTyping()\n* @JsonTypeInfo using id.CLASS or id.MINIMAL_CLASS\n* oadd.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool in classpath",
