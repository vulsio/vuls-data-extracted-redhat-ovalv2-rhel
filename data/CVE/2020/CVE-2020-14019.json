				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Open-iSCSI rtslib-fb through versions 2.1.72, where it has weak permissions for /etc/target/saveconfig.json because the shutil.copyfile, instead of shutil.copy is used, and permissions are not preserved upon editing. This flaw allows an attacker with prior access to /etc/target/saveconfig.json to access a later version, resulting in a loss of integrity, depending on their permission settings. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 are not affected because within the affected method, shutil.copyfile is not used. However, the affected method, save_to_file is outdated and contains a race condition. Hence, this issue has been rated as having a security impact of low.",
