				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in gdisks' LoadPartitionTable() function of 'gpt.cc'. The exploitation of this flaw requires the use of a malicious storage device (for example, a USB Stick) that can cause a crash when physically inserted into the system and possible local privilege escalation. This flaw allows an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and data availability. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 because our code-base is vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as a Moderate security impact and the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Update Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
