				"title": "CVE-2020-17521 groovy: OS temporary directory leads to information disclosure (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Groovy. Groovy makes use of a method for creating temporary directories which is not suitable for security-sensitive contexts and allows for sensitive information leakage. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is rated as having a security impact of Moderate and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the vulnerable version of groovy is delivered in jenkins package and openshift4/ose-metering-hive container. The vulnerable groovy extension methods are not used directly in these components, therefore the impact by this vulnerability is Low.\n\nAlthough an affected version of groovy is shipped in CodeReady Studio, the vulnerable functionality is not used by default, so the impact of this vulnerability is set to Low.\n\nRed Hat CodeReady WorkSpaces 2.7.0 does not ship groovy so is not affected by this flaw.\n            MITIGATION: Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability for all operating systems and all Groovy versions. Users who cannot easily move to the fixed Groovy versions may wish to consider using the JDKâ€™s Files#createTempDirectory method instead of the Groovy extension methods.",
