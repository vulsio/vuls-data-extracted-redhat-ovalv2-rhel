				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Integer underflow in OpenSSL before 0.9.8x, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0j, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1c, when TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, or DTLS is used with CBC encryption, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TLS packet that is not properly handled during a certain explicit IV calculation. \n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4. The openssl versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were partially affected, as they support DTLS, but they do not support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 via RHSA-2012:0699.",
