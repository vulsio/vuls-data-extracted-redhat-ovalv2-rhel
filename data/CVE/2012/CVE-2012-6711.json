				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in GNU Bash before 4.3 when wide characters, not supported by the current locale set in the LC_CTYPE environment variable, are printed through the echo built-in function. A local attacker, who can provide data to print through the \"echo -e\" built-in function, may use this flaw to crash a script or execute code with the privileges of the bash process. This occurs because ansicstr() in lib/sh/strtrans.c mishandles u32cconv(). \n            STATEMENT: Impact set to Moderate as the flaw requires the usage of `echo -e` built-in function with a string controlled by the attacker. Abusing this flaw would allow an attacker to, at most, execute code with the privileges of the bash process, which could be used e.g. to escape a restricted shell in case of a local attacker scenario or remotely execute code in case of a bash script that accepts untrusted input from the network. However we do not recommend to use bash scripts to handle untrusted data from the network.",
