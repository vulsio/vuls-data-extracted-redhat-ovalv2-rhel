				"title": "ctorName in index.js allows external user input to overwrite certain internal attributes (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-kind-of. An external user is allowed input to overwrite certain internal attributes via a conflicting name, as demonstrated by 'constructor': {'name':'Symbol'}. Hence, a crafted payload can overwrite this builtin attribute to manipulate the type detection result. \n            STATEMENT: While some components do package a vulnerable version of `kind-of`, access to them requires OpenShift OAuth credentials and hence have been marked with a Low impact. This applies to the following products:\n- OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM)\n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM)\n- OpenShift distributed tracing\n- OpenShift Data Foundation \n\nIn Openshift Container Platform (OCP) 4.6 the openshift4/ose-logging-kibana container delivers a vulnerable version of `kind-of`,  however OCP 4.6 is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities. Since the release of OCP 4.7 this component is now delivered as part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/kibana6-rhel8 container). Further, OCP 3.11 has been set to Will not fix, as OCP 3.11 is moving into maintenance phase of support.\n\nIn Red Hat Virtualization some components do package a version of `kind-of`, however none use an affected version (later than 6.0.0, prior to 6.0.3)",
