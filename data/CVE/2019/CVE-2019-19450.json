				"title": "python-reportlab: code injection in paraparser.py allows code execution (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A code injection vulnerability was found in python-reportlab that may allow an attacker to execute code while parsing a unichar element attribute. An application that uses python-reportlab to parse untrusted input files may be vulnerable and could allow remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: To exploit the issue, a malicious user has to use a crafted malicious html 'unichar' tag input and then use the reportlab's feature to generate a pdf of the document and that can lead to a remote code execution, therefore, this CVE has an Important impact.\n\nThis vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-17626.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
