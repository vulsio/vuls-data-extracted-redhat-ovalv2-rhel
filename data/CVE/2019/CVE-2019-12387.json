				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: In Twisted before 19.2.1, twisted.web did not validate or sanitize URIs or HTTP methods, allowing an attacker to inject invalid characters such as CRLF. \n            STATEMENT: * This issue does not affect Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 because these products do not use the twisted web APIs.\n* This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. However, because this version is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase and the flaw has a security impact of Moderate,  it is not currently planned to be addressed in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package.",
