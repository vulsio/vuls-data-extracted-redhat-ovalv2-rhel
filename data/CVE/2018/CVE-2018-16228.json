				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in tcpdump where an uninitialized buffer is accessed in tcpdump while printing HNCP packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when printed, would trigger the flaw and crash the application. System availability is the highest threat from this vulnerability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect the versions of tcpdump as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they already include the patch.",
