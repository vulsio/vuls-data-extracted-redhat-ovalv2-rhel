				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that the \"setElementTypePrefix()\" function incorrectly extracted XML namespace prefixes. By tricking an application into processing a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could cause unusually high consumption of memory resources and possibly lead to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: When processing a specially crafted XML file, expat may use more memory than ultimately necessary, which can also lead to increased CPU usage and longer processing times. Depending on available system resources and configuration, this may also lead to the application triggering the Out-Of-Memory-Killer, causing the application to be terminated.",
