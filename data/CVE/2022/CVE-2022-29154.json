				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rsync that is triggered by a victim rsync user/client connecting to a malicious rsync server. The server can copy and overwrite arbitrary files in the client's rsync target directory and subdirectories. This flaw allows a malicious server, or in some cases, another attacker who performs a man-in-the-middle attack, to potentially overwrite sensitive files on the client machine, resulting in further exploitation. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Only connecting to trusted Rsync servers over trusted channels would help to mitigate this flaw.",
