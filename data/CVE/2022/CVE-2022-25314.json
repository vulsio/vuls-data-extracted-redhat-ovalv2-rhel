				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw was found in expat. This issue affects the encoding name parameter at the parser creation time, which is often hard-coded (rather than user input), takes a value in the gigabytes to trigger, and on a 64-bit machine. This flaw can cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a severity of Moderate. The encoding name parameter is often hard-coded (rather than user input) and it would take a value in the gigabytes for the name to trigger this issue. The versions of `expat` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected by this flaw as they did not include the vulnerable copyString() function.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation other than restricting applications using the expat library from processing untrusted XML content.",
