				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A flaw was found in New Horizon Datasys bootloaders before 2022-06-01. An attacker may use this bootloader to bypass or tamper with Secure Boot protections. In order to load and execute arbitrary code in the pre-boot stage, an attacker simply needs to replace the existing signed bootloader currently in use with this bootloader. Access to the EFI System Partition is required for booting using external media. \n            STATEMENT: The shim packages distributed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8 and 9 is not affected by this issue, however as the 3rd party affected shim is trusted by the UEFI platform an attacker can still use it to subvert secure boot protections in Red Hat Enterprise Linux installed systems. Red Hat is working to provide a DBX update via fwupd package to prevent affected components to be booted successfully.",
