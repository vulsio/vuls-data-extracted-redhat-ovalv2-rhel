				"title": "gzip: arbitrary-file-write vulnerability (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system. \n            STATEMENT: This bug was introduced in gzip-1.3.10 and is relatively hard to exploit.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected but Out of Support Cycle because gzip was not listed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ELS Inclusion List.\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/4997301\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
