				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nA file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user confusion and the execution of malicious code. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of this flaw as determined by the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory. Note that this CVE was actually fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1 despite being initially included in the advisories for Thunderbird 102.6. A future update for Thunderbird 102.7 will address this CVE in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
