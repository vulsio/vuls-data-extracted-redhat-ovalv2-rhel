				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libXpm. When processing files with .Z or .gz extensions, the library calls external programs to compress and uncompress files, relying on the PATH environment variable to find these programs, which could allow a malicious user to execute other programs by manipulating the PATH environment variable. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is affected but out of support scope because libXpm is not listed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ELS Inclusion List[1].\n\n[1]. https://access.redhat.com/articles/4997301\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
