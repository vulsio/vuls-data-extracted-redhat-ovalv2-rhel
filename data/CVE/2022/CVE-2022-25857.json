				"title": "snakeyaml: Denial of Service due to missing nested depth limitation for collections (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the org.yaml.snakeyaml package. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) due to missing nested depth limitation for collections. \n            STATEMENT: For RHEL-8 it's downgraded to moderate because \"snakeyaml\" itself in RHEL 8 or RHEL-9 isn't shipped and \"prometheus-jmx-exporter\" is needed as build dependency. And it's not directly exploitable, hence severity marked as moderate.\nRed Hat Integration and AMQ products are not vulnerable to this flaw, so their severity has been lowered to moderate.\nRed Hat Single Sign-On uses snakeyaml from liquibase-core and is only used when performing migrations and would require administrator privileges to execute, hence severity marked as Low.\nRed Hat Fuse 7 is now in Maintenance Support Phase and details about its fix should be present soon. However, Red Hat Fuse Online (Syndesis) does will not contain the fix for this flaw.",
