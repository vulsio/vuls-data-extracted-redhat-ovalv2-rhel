				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. \n            STATEMENT: The Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having low security impact in Red Hat Enterpise MRG 1 and 2, CloudForms 3, and Red Hat Network Satellite 5. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.Redhat satellite 6 does not ship libyaml\n\nThe Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having low security impact in Red Hat Update Infrastructure. A future update may address this issue. \n\nThe Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in Subscription Asset Manager 1. A future update may address this issue.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
