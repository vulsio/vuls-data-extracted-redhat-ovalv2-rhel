				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-beaker, where it is affected by the deserialization of untrusted data. This flaw allows an attacker to enter malicious payloads into the cache database (for example, if they are on the network and have credentials for the database), to perform remote code execution on the machine running Beaker, due to the deserialization of data from the cache database by Pickle. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Implementing proper access control on the Beaker cache database, to prevent unauthorized writes into the database, will mitigate exploitation of this flaw. This flaw also cannot be triggered if the Cache functionality of Beaker is not used. When using the Session feature of Beaker, use the signing functionality to verify the integrity of the data retrieved from the database before deserialization.",
