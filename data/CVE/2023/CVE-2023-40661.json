				"title": "OpenSC: multiple memory issues with pkcs15-init (enrollment tool) (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly in the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow \ncompromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.",
