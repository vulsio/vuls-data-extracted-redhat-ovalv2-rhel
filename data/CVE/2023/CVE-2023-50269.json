				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Squid, which is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug, specifically targeting HTTP Request parsing. Exploiting this issue involves a remote client initiating a DoS attack by sending an oversized X-Forwarded-For header when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This issue poses a threat to the stability and availability of the Squid service. \n            STATEMENT: Squid configurations lacking the \"follow_x_forwarded_for\" setting are not susceptible to the vulnerability.\n            MITIGATION: Remove all \"follow_x_forwarded_for\" lines from squid.conf.",
