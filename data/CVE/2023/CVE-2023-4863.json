				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap-based buffer flaw was found in the way libwebp, a library used to process \"WebP\" image format data, processes certain specially formatted WebP images. An attacker could use this flaw to crash or execute remotely arbitrary code in an application such as a web browser compiled with this library. \n            STATEMENT: This security issue has been classified as having an Important security impact. Desktop users are at a high risk of exploitation of this flaw with very minimal interaction. It may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources.\n\nCustomers using this application, which does server-side image processing by linking to the libwebp library, are also potentially impacted by this flaw and are advised to update to the fixed versions of the package.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
