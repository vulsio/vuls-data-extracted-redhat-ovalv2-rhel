				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the GeoMap Grafana plugin, where a user can store unsanitized HTML in the GeoMap plugin under the Attribution text field, and the client will process it. The vulnerability makes it possible to use XHR to make arbitrary API calls on behalf of the attacked user. This means that a malicious user with editor permissions could alter a GeoMap panel to include JavaScript that changes the password for the user viewing the panel (this could be an admin) to a known password, thus gaining access to the admin account and resulting as the editor becoming an admin. \n            STATEMENT: For Grafana package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is not possible to take advantage of this vulnerability without specialized 'editor' access, which reduces the impact of this issue in RHEL. Thus, it is set to Moderate.\n            MITIGATION: Applying the Content-Security-Policy shipped with Grafana would block inline scripts from executing and would mitigate this.",
