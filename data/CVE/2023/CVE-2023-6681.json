				"title": "JWCrypto: denail of service  Via specifically crafted JWE (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in JWCrypto. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack and possible password brute-force and dictionary attacks to be more resource-intensive. This issue can result in a large amount of computational consumption, causing a denial of service attack. \n            STATEMENT: The identified vulnerability within the jwcrypto package, presents a moderate severity concern rather than a important one due to several mitigating factors. While the unbounded PBES2 Count value in PBKDF2 algorithms can potentially facilitate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, its severity is tempered by the fact that successful exploitation requires specific conditions and considerable computational resources. Additionally, applications not reliant on PBKDF2 can easily exclude it from their algorithms list, further reducing exposure.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
