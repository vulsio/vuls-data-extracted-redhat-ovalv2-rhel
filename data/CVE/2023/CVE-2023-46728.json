				"title": "squid: NULL pointer dereference in the gopher protocol code (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Squid's Gopher gateway. The gopher protocol is always available and enabled in Squid. This issue may lead to a remote denial of service via gopher URL requests. \n            \n            MITIGATION: To mitigate this issue, create an access list configuration to reject all gopher URL requests:\n\nSet ACL directives in your squid.conf file (or equivalent) as follows:\nacl gopher proto gopher\nhttp_access deny gopher\n\nImportant: This sequence must be placed above any lines starting with \"http_access allow\" in your configuration.\nObservation: Some loss of performance may occur with this configuration.",
