				"title": "nodejs-handlebars: Remote code execution when compiling untrusted compile templates with strict:true option (low)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-handlebars. A missing check when getting prototype properties in the template function allows an attacker, who can provide untrusted handlebars templates, to execute arbitrary code in the javascript system (e.g. browser or server) when the template is compiled with the strict:true option. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 delivers the kibana package which includes Handlebars.js. From OCP 4.6, the kibana package is no longer shipped and will not be fixed. \nThe openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6 container includes Handlebars.js directly as container first code.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) some components include the vulnerable handlebars library, but access is protected by OpenShift OAuth what reducing impact by this flaw to LOW.\n\nRed Hat Quay includes Handlebars.js as a development dependency. It does not use Handlebars.js at runtime to process templates so have been given a low impact rating.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 bundles vulnerable Handlebars.js (with pcs), however it does not use \"strict\" option and templates from external sources, hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.\n\nIn Red Hat Virtualization ovirt-engine-ui-extensions and ovirt-web-ui Handlebars.js is included as a dependency of conventional-changelog-writer,  it does not impact production code and as such has been given a low impact rating and set to wontfix. Handlebars.js may be updated to a newer version in future updates.",
