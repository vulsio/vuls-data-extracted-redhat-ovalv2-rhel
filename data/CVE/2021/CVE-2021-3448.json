				"title": "CVE-2021-3448 dnsmasq: fixed outgoing port used when --server is used with an interface name (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in dnsmasq. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity. \n            \n            MITIGATION: The flaw can be prevented by removing `--server=<address>@<interface>` option or by removing the directive `server=<address>@<interface>`. If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, please be aware that NetworkManager automatically configures dnsmasq to use the `server=<address>@<interface>` directive, thus in this case the only way to prevent the flaw is to remove `dns=dnsmasq` from /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file.\n\nIf the `server=<address>@<interface>` must be kept active, the impact of this flaw can be reduced by disabling the dnsmasq cache by adding `--cache-size=0` when calling dnsmasq or by adding a line with `cache-size=0` to the dnsmasq configuration file (/etc/dnsmasq.conf by default). If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, create a new file in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/ and add `cache-size=0` to it.\n\nBy disabling the cache, you may experience a performance loss in your environment due to all DNS queries being forwarded to the upstream servers. Please evaluate if the mitigation is appropriate for the systemâ€™s environment before applying.",
