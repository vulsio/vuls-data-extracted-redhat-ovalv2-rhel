				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack can be performed in mailman due to a CSRF token bypass. CSRF tokens are not checked against the right type of user when performing admin operations and a token created by a regular user can be used by an admin to perform an admin-level request, effectively bypassing the protection provided by CSRF tokens. A remote attacker with an account on the mailman system can use this flaw to perform a CSRF attack and perform operations on behalf of the victim admin. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
