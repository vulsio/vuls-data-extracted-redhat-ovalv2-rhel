				"title": "CVE-2021-28652 squid: denial of service issue in Cache Manager (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Squid. A parser validation bug could allow a trusted client with Cache Manager API access privileges to trigger memory leaks, potentially resulting in a denial of service against Squid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. At this stage in their life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 only accept Important and Critical Security Advisories (RHSAs) and this flaw does not meet these criteria. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\n\nRed Hat Satellite does not ship the Squid package, however, does consume it from RHEL 7 repository. Product is not affected by this flaw as squid.conf configuration disables all the http_access fragments except the localhost.\n            MITIGATION: To mitigate this flaw Cache Manager access privileges can be hardened, for example by requiring authentication or other access controls in the \"http_access\" directive beyond the default IP address restriction. Alternatively, Cache Manager access can be disabled entirely if not needed. To do so, place the following line in `squid.conf` before lines containing \"allow\" :\n\n```\nhttp_access deny manager\n```",
