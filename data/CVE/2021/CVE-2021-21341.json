				"title": "CVE-2021-21341 XStream: allow a remote attacker to cause DoS only by manipulating the processed input stream (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) delivers Jenkins LTS package with bundled XStream library. Due to JEP-200 [1] and JEP-228 [2] Jenkins projects, OCP Jenkins package is not affected by this flaw.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/200/README.adoc\n[2] https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc#security",
