				"title": "Intel Processor Breakpoint Control Flow (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in microcode. Under complex microarchitectural conditions, an unexpected code breakpoint may cause a system hang. The hang was observed on a Skylake server processor, and subsequent analysis indicated additional potentially affected processors. This flaw allows a possible temporary denial of service (TDOS) to occur. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content. In most cases, it merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat-owned development processes and QA documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information, please contact the binary content vendor.",
