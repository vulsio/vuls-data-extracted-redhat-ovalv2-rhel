				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in microcode. An out-of-bounds read under a complex microarchitectural condition in the memory subsystem for some Intel Atom(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure or cause a denial of service via network access. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content and in most cases merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat owned development processes and QA, documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information please contact the binary content vendor.",
