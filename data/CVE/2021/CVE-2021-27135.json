				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in xterm. A specially crafted sequence of combining characters causes an out of bounds write leading to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. \n            \n            MITIGATION: This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling UTF-8 support in XTerm configuration.  An entry such as \"XTerm.vt100.utf8: false\" in Xresources will disable UTF-8.  This can be set as a system default in /etc/X11/Xresources, or per-user in ~/.Xresources.\n\nNote that this setting can still be overridden if xterm is invoked with the \"-u8\" command line option, so the mitigation may not protect all use cases.",
