				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An input validation flaw was found in Squid. This issue could allow a malicious server in collaboration with a trusted client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of memory on the server running Squid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. At this stage in their life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 only accept Important and Critical Security Advisories (RHSAs) and this flaw does not meet these criteria. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\n\nRed Hat Satellite does not ship the Squid package, however, does consume it from RHEL 7 repository. Product is not affected by this flaw as squid.conf configuration disables all the http_access fragments except the localhost.\n            MITIGATION: If possible, disable URN processing by adding the following lines in `squid.conf`:\n\n```\nacl URN proto URN\nhttp_access deny URN\n```",
