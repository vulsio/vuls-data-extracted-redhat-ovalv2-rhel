The attack needs to be initiated locally where an attacker could convince a victim to read a specially crafted file which is processed by cxxfilt, leading to disclosure of memory and possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code or causing the utility to crash. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact and the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and above are shipped with binutils v2.30 and upper versions which are not affected by this vulnerability.",
