				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap out-of-bounds read flaw was found in WavPacks' WavpackPackSamples() function of src/pack_utils.c and only affects the command-line program of WavPack (not libwavpack). This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this flaw for a website that uses the WavPack command-line program on user-provided files, causing a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, and since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
