				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A buffer over-read flaw was found in the test case reader in libsolv that created multiple out-of-bounds read symptoms. Depending on how client applications use libsolv, this flaw leads to a denial of service of the application if an attacker can supply crafted input to the test case reader. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been marked as Low impact because it is in the test case reader and is an out-of-bounds read.\n\nThis issue is related to already fixed issue (https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/commit/0077ef29eb46d2e1df2f230fc95a1d9748d49dec) that is part of libsolv-0.7.17. \n\nRHEL-8.6.z and above, and RHEL-9 ships versions of libsolv greater than 0.7.17. Hence, as the flaw is having LOW security impact, Red Hat Enterprise Linux - 8, 9 are set to not affected. However, RHEL-8 streams that ships libsolv versions prior to 0.7.17 are still affected. \nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
