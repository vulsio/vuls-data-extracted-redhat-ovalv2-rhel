The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            \n            MITIGATION: This flaw is in utf8 processing; if your screen configuration does not enable utf8 (through configuration such as \"defencoding utf-8\" in .screenrc), you are not vulnerable.",
