				"title": "dompurify: XSS vulnerability via prototype pollution (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in DOMPurify. This issue may allow an attacker to use specially-crafted HTML to bypass the depth checking or use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check, which can lead to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in DOMPurify, while significant, is categorized as moderate severity rather than important due to its specific conditions for exploitation. The issue requires not only a sophisticated nesting technique to bypass the depth checks but also the ability to leverage Prototype Pollution to weaken these protections. This makes the attack scenario relatively complex and less likely to be encountered in general use cases. Furthermore, the flaw impacts only certain configurations and usage patterns, thus reducing its immediate risk.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
