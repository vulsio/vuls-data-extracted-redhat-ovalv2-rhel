				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Linux PTP. This flaw allows an attacker to possibly trigger a denial of service via a specially crafted Pdelay_Req message to the time synchronization function. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is categorized as a Moderate severity rather than Important because it specifically targets the time synchronization function on a single port rather than causing broader system or network compromise. The attack requires the attacker to be on the same Ethernet network, limiting its scope and accessibility. Additionally, the denial of service is temporary, affecting synchronization only for a limited duration, after which normal operation may resume without permanent damage to the system.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
