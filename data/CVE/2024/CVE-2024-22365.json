				"title": "pam: allowing unprivileged user to block another user namespace (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Linux PAM. An unprivileged user that is not yet in a corresponding mount namespace with ~/tmp mounted as a polyinstantiated dir can place a FIFO there, and a subsequent attempt to login as this user with `pam_namespace` configured will cause the `openat()` in `protect_dir()` to block the attempt, causing a local denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this as Moderate, as this vulnerability needs a non-default configuration in order to be explored by a malicious user. Also, the attack is local and the Denial of Service happens to a single user.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
