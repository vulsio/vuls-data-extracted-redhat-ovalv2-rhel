				"title": "mod_auth_openidc: DoS when using `OIDCSessionType client-cookie` and manipulating cookies (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc, an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorization module for the Apache HTTP server. Missing input validation in the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value can make the server vulnerable to a denial of service attack. This issue may allow a remote attacker to craft a request that causes the application or system to slow down or crash due to unhandled errors. \n            STATEMENT: The identified vulnerability in the application's handling of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie represents a moderate severity issue rather than a important one due to several factors. While the ability for attackers to craft requests causing server strain and potential unresponsiveness poses a threat to the availability of the service, it requires specific conditions to exploit. The attack relies on manipulating a specific cookie with an exceptionally large value, which may not be easily achievable without user interaction or prior access to the system. Additionally, the impact is limited to denial of service rather than compromising sensitive data or system integrity.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
