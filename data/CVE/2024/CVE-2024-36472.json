				"title": "gnome-shell: code execution in portal helper (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in GNOME Shell. A portal helper can be launched automatically without user confirmation based on the network responses provided by an adversary. \n            STATEMENT: Although this vulnerability may be triggered without user interaction required, it needs an attacker to control the local network and perform a man in the middle attack. That would then open a vector of attack through a web portal that could run malicious javascript code, but the attack would still need to chain other vulnerabilities to be able to harm the host, such as memory safety vulnerabilities and web process sandbox escaping. Hence this issue was rated as Moderate.",
