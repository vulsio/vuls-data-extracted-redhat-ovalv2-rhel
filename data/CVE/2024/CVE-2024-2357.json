				"title": "libreswan: Missing PreSharedKey for connection can cause crash (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Libreswan. This issue causes Libreswan to restart under some IKEv2 retransmit scenarios when a connection is configured to use PreSharedKeys (authby=secret), and the connection cannot find a matching configured secret. When automatically added on startup using the auto= keyword, it can cause repeated crashes, leading to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Libreswan may restart repeatedly under certain IKEv2 retransmission scenarios when using PreSharedKeys (authby=secret) if the connection cannot find a matching configured secret. If such a connection is added automatically on startup using the auto= keyword, it can lead to repeated crashes, causing a denial of service. The vulnerability arises when IKEv2 fails to find its PreSharedKey for the AUTH payload in the IKE_AUTH Exchange, resulting in assertion failure and daemon crashes. This vulnerability is triggered by local misconfiguration, and there is no known exploitation by external peers.\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround to prevent the misconfiguration from causing the crash, place an unguessable long random \"catch-all\" secret in /etc/ipsec.secrets, for example, using the following command:\n\necho -e \"# CVE-2024-2357 workaround\\n: PSK \\\"$(openssl rand -hex 32)\\\"\" >> /etc/ipsec.secrets\n\nThis will ensure a PSK secret is always found, but it will always be wrong, and thus authentication will still properly fail.",
