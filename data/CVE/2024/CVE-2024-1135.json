				"title": "python-gunicorn: HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper validation of Transfer-Encoding headers (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability was found in Gunicorn. By crafting requests with conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. This vulnerability allows for a range of attacks, including cache poisoning, session manipulation, and data exposure. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
