				"title": "bearertokenauthextension: Observable Timing Discrepancy in github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in OpenTelemetry, specifically in the github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension. This flaw impacts anyone using the bearertokenauth server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This issue allows an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
