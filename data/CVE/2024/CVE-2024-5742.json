				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in GNU Nano that allows a possible privilege escalation through an insecure temporary file. If Nano is killed while editing, a file it saves to an emergency file with the permissions of the running user provides a window of opportunity for attackers to escalate privileges through a malicious symlink. \n            STATEMENT: For an attack to be successful, an attacker must be able to kill the Nano session of another user, hence this issue was rated as a Low severity issue.",
