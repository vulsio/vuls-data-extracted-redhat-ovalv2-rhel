				"title": "rear: creates a world-readable initrd (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability has been identified in Relax-and-Recover (ReaR), where the use of GRUB_RESCUE=y results in the creation of an initrd that is readable by anyone. This flaw could potentially enable local attackers to obtain access to system secrets that are typically restricted to root privileges. \n            STATEMENT: A moderate security concern has been identified in Relax-and-Recover (ReaR), particularly when the non-default configuration GRUB_RESCUE=y is used within Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This setting results in the creation of a world-readable initrd, potentially providing local attackers an avenue to access system secrets usually restricted to root privileges. It's worth noting that the default initrd created by ReaR does not contain secrets.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
