				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the glibc netgroup cache. In certain conditions, its possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow condition that can lead to a denial of service and potentially other malicious actions that impact confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: This stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in nscd presents a important severity issue due to its potential to be exploited by malicious actors to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. By carefully crafting input data, an attacker could manipulate the program's control flow, leading to unintended behavior such as executing arbitrary commands, escalating privileges, or crashing the application. Since the overflow occurs in a critical system component responsible for caching name service data, exploitation could have far-reaching consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive information or disruption of essential services.\n\n\nThis issue affects the nscd RPM package and not the glibc RPM package itself. Affected components are tracked by their RPM source package, in this case, the nscd binary package is built from the glibc source package, hence the affected component is glibc.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
