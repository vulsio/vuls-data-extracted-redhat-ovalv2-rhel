				"title": "gstreamer1-plugins-good: null pointer dereference in gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10. \n            STATEMENT: To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into opening or process a specially crafted file with the gdk-pixbuf decoder. As user interaction is required to trigger is issue and the impact is limited to an application crash, this flaw has been rated with a moderate severity.\n            MITIGATION: Do not process untrusted files with the gdk-pixbuf decoder and monitor application crashes as this may indicate exploitation attempts.",
