				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. An integer overflow in the MP4/MOV demuxer's sample table parser can lead to out-of-bounds writes and NULL-pointer dereferences for certain input files. This vulnerability allows a malicious third party to trigger an application crash and, in the case of out-of-bounds writes, possibly allow code execution through heap manipulation. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
