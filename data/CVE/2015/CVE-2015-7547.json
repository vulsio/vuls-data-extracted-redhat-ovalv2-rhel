				"title": "getaddrinfo stack-based buffer overflow (critical)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library performed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or, potentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the library. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the nss_dns NSS service module. \n            STATEMENT: After updating the glibc package on affected systems, it is strongly recommended to reboot the system or restart all the affected services. For more information please refer to: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2161461",
