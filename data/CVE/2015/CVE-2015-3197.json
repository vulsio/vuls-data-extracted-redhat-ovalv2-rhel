				"title": "CVE-2015-3197 OpenSSL: SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers (low)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that were disabled on the server. This could result in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. \n            STATEMENT: This security flaw can only be exploited when a malicious client negotiates SSLv2 ciphers and completes a SSLv2 handshake. This flaw cannot be actively exploited by a Man-In-The-Middle attacker. \n\nAll versions of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux enable SSLv2 protocol, but disable SSLv2 ciphers by default (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later), therefore are vulnerable to this flaw. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.\n\nSSLv2 suffers from a number of security flaws allowing attackers to capture and alter information passed between a client and the server. Therefore we strongly recommend that SSLv2 should be disabled on all the SSL/TLS servers.",
